        We are <a href="/">Typesafe Utrecht</a>, a meetup group, which welcomes
        everyone, who has an opinion on strong typing in programming languages.
        Let's go cross-lingual and discuss the basics of type systems, compare
        different implementations and follow the newest developments.
        Developers, computer scientists and all sympathetic are welcome.

        Fantasy? No, it's functional programming. We need to embrace functional
        programming in typesafe languages, because it not only greatly improves
        development experience quality of our programs...
