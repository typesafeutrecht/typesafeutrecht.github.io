Write a program that describes the data generation process and let an inference engine take care of fitting it to the actual data.<br/>It turns out that this can be achieved with the addition of a few keywords to the language. Scala-infer leverages meta-programming in Scala to implement the keywords and hooks them up with fast, approximate, inference.</p> <p>Frank will provide a gentle introduction to probabilistic programming, along with the technology (macros, reverse auto-diff) we need to implement the abstraction.</p> <p>The full project is available at <a href=\\"https://github.com/fvlankvelt/scala-infer\\" class=\\"linkified\\">https://github.com/fvlankvelt/scala-infer</a></p>","how_to_find_us":"Exit the train station through the shopping mall to the right of the city center and walk a bit.","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Typesafe-Utrecht/events/257778500/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"duration":10800000,"announced":true,"name":"Talks and drinks: Akka Typed and Scala Infer","id":"257778500","time":1548262800000,"updated":1548279170000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1540733310000,"name":"Typesafe Utrecht","group_lon":5.110000133514404,"id":30411303,"urlname":"Typesafe-Utrecht","group_lat":52.099998474121094,"who":"Members"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","city":"Utrecht","address_1":"Papendorpseweg 96","name":"bol.com","lon":5.089322,"id":26069016,"lat":52.065834,"repinned":true},"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1552216029000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Hey type ninjas!</p> <p>We\'ve got a new meetup coming up this month with two amazing speakers: Rahul Sethi, a special guest from London, and Anton Vanco, our local Scala enthusiast from Utrecht, who will share their experiences with solving some generic problems.</p> <p>TypeScript: Typing Existing Patterns</p> <p>JavaScript had a pretty good run without types.
